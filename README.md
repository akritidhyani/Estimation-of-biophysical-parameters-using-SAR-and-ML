In this study, we explore the potential of combining optical data from Sentinel-2 and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 for estimating these parameters in mango orchards situated in Siyana, Uttar Pradesh, India. A comprehensive analysis was conducted, including the derivation of various vegetation indices (VIs) from Sentinel-2 imagery and the extraction of VV and VH polarizations from Sentinel-1 SAR data. Correlation analysis and univariate statistical models were employed to examine the relationships between these remote sensing variables and field-measured biophysical parameters. Furthermore,different Machine Learrning models are used for the estimation purposes. The findings indicate that integrating SAR data, particularly VV and VH polarizations, with optical VIs significantly improves estimation accuracy compared to using optical data alone. This study underscores the synergistic benefits of multi-sensor data fusion for precise retrieval of biophysical parameters in mango orchards, facilitating enhanced orchard monitoring and management practices.
The study was carried out at Siyana Block in Uttar pradesh. Geographically, Siyana is located at gps coordinates of 28° 37' 40.4796'' N and 78° 3' 39.2868'' E. The various biophysical parameters LAI, orchard height, Diameter Breast height, Canopy Circumference were measured. The locations of all the plots were marked with the help of Global Positioning System (GPS) for the data collection. Remote Sensing variables such as NDVI, LSWI, EVI, NDRE, VV, VH, VV/VH, MPDI were calculated using Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 data in Google Earth Engine for the month of February 2023. February was selected since it is the peak flowering time for mango, for calculating indices values for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data in Google Earth Engine for Siyana's mango orchards. During this period, high backscatter ensures better differentiation of mango orchards from surrounding land cover types, reducing pixel mixing and improving accuracy in estimating biophysical parameters. Unlike optical data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data used from Sentinel-1 does not require preprocessing in GEE. SAR penetrates clouds and provides reliable data even under cloud cover, eliminating the need for preprocessing and ensuring continuous monitoring of orchard dynamics regardless of weather conditions.
